# Bank-Simulation
Implements a simulation that mimics the arrival of customers, service by the Teller and successful departure of a customer. 

->The simulation identifies the time of different events in the system, as well as the time that a customer is waiting to be served, the time duration for which a customer is being served etc. 

->The simulation identifies a Poisson distribution for inter-arrival time, and an exponential distribution for service time. 

->uniform.cpp = assumes a uniform flow of the customers and shows the result accordingly.

->generator.cpp = generates the arrival and process time files for the poission distribution using(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution)

->poisson.cpp = uses the files generated by generator.cpp for poission and exponential distribution(same as uniform.cpp but with different file names)
